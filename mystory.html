    <p1><br><br>Amy Willoughby is originally from Clayton, California. She received her Undergraduate Degree from the University of California, Santa Barbara in Cultural Anthropology and Film and Media Studies. 
    <br><br>
    She first learned about GIS and data collection in the Pima Archaeology Field School on Catalina Island and knew she needed to learn more. Amy could tell GIS would be useful over many industries besides one of her main interests: archaeology. 
    <br><br>
    In 2015 she went back to school and earned a Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Science with a 4.0 GPA from the University of Southern California. Amy then went on to enroll in the GIS Master's of Science program at the University of Wisconsin, Madison where she is currently learning programming and cartography skills to enhance her GIS expertise.
    <br><br>
    Amy currently works in the utility data services industry, her first job in the GIS world, and hopes to keep learning and growing throughout her career.
